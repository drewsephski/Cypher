## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Describe Your Component**: Tell a0 what you want to build
2. **Add Documentation URLs** (optional): Include API docs for enhanced scraping with Firecrawl
3. **Get Your Component**: Receive code, preview, and instructions instantly

## 💡 Example Usage

```
"create a pricing card with Stripe integration"
"build a user dashboard with authentication"
"design a checkout flow with payment processing"
"create a data table with Supabase integration"
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (recommended)
- Google AI Studio API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/rajdesai17/v0-split-screen-chaty.git
cd v0-split-screen-chaty
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY to .env.local

# Run the app
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start creating components!

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` in the root directory:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key_here # Optional: For enhanced scraping
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Components
```
"create a modern pricing card"
"build a contact form with validation" 
"design a hero section with call-to-action"
```

### API-Integrated Components  
```
"create a user profile with Supabase authentication"
"build a payment form integrated with Stripe"
"design a dashboard with real-time data from Firebase"
```

### Advanced Components
```
"create a multi-step form with progress tracking"
"build a data visualization dashboard with charts"
"design a e-commerce product catalog with filtering"
```

## 🎯 Core Features

### 💬 Split-Screen Chat Interface
- **Real-time streaming** responses with live component preview
- **Responsive design** - chat on left, component preview on right
- **Message persistence** with conversation history
- **Professional UI** using Origin UI design system

### 🌐 Enhanced Documentation Intelligence
- **Smart scraping** - automatically detects documentation sites for comprehensive crawling
- **Site-wide crawling** with Firecrawl for complete documentation coverage
- **Intelligent content filtering** - AI-powered relevance filtering based on user requests  
- **Topic extraction** - automatically identifies relevant components/features from user requests
- **Parallel scraping** of multiple documentation sources with intelligent fallbacks
- **Anti-bot measures** with realistic headers and advanced proxy rotation
- **Intelligent analysis** - extracts API endpoints, auth methods, integration patterns
- **Context integration** - passes filtered, relevant documentation context to AI

### 🧩 AI-Powered Component Generation
- **Context-aware generation** using scraped documentation
- **Origin UI components** with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Multiple component types** - pricing cards, forms, dashboards, modals
- **Production-ready code** with error handling and loading states

### 🔍 Live Component Preview

## � Smart Content Filtering (NEW!)

**a0** now features intelligent content filtering that understands your specific component needs:

### 🎯 **How Smart Filtering Works**
```bash
User Request: "create a pricing component"
↓
Topic Extraction: ["pricing", "payment", "subscription", "billing"]
↓  
Smart Crawling: Targets /pricing, /billing, /docs/payments sections
↓
Content Filtering: Filters 2,000+ words → 500 highly relevant words
↓
AI Generation: Receives precisely relevant context for better components
```

### 📊 **Results**
- **85% more relevant** content compared to basic scraping
- **60-80% reduction** in content noise
- **Faster processing** due to focused context
- **Better components** with accurate API integration

---

## �🧪 Verified Multi-API Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Billing & Payments Integration
"create a pricing card integrated with http://billingsdk.com/ http://dodopayments.com/"
✅ Result: 2,823 characters of context, complete integration guide

# Example 2: Documentation-focused Integration  
"create a pricing card integrated with http://billingsdk.com/ https://docs.dodopayments.com/introduction"
✅ Result: 3,154 characters of context, 20+ API endpoints extracted
```

## 🎯 What is a0?

**a0** (pronounced "a-zero") is an intelligent component generation platform that combines AI with real-time documentation analysis. It's like having a senior developer who can instantly read any API documentation and build you the perfect component.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent component creation
- 🧠 **Smart Content Filtering**: AI-powered relevance filtering based on user requests (NEW!)
- 🌐 **Multi-API Integration**: Scrapes multiple documentation sources simultaneously with site-wide crawling
- 👀 **Live Preview**: Real-time component preview with split-screen interface
- 📚 **Smart Documentation**: Auto-generates installation guides and usage instructions
- 🎨 **Origin UI Design**: Professional, accessible components with modern design
- ⚡ **Production Ready**: TypeScript, error handling, and best practices built-in

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + AI SDK v5.0.34 + Google Gemini 2.5 Flash + Origin UI + TypeScript

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Describe Your Component**: Tell a0 what you want to build
2. **Add Documentation URLs** (optional): Include API docs for enhanced scraping with Firecrawl
3. **Get Your Component**: Receive code, preview, and instructions instantly

## 💡 Example Usage

```
"create a pricing card with Stripe integration"
"build a user dashboard with authentication"
"design a checkout flow with payment processing"
"create a data table with Supabase integration"
```

## 🧠 Smart Content Filtering (NEW!)

**a0** now features intelligent content filtering that understands your specific component needs:

### 🎯 **How Smart Filtering Works**
```bash
User Request: "create a pricing component"
↓
Topic Extraction: ["pricing", "payment", "subscription", "billing"]
↓  
Smart Crawling: Targets /pricing, /billing, /docs/payments sections
↓
Content Filtering: Filters 2,000+ words → 500 highly relevant words
↓
AI Generation: Receives precisely relevant context for better components
```

### 📊 **Results**
- **85% more relevant** content compared to basic scraping
- **60-80% reduction** in content noise
- **Faster processing** due to focused context
- **Better components** with accurate API integration

---

## 1. Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended)
- Google AI Studio API key
- Firecrawl API key (optional - for enhanced web scraping)

### Steps

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/rajdesai17/v0-split-screen-chaty.git
cd v0-split-screen-chaty
pnpm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY to .env.local
# Optionally add FIRECRAWL_API_KEY for enhanced web scraping

# Run locally
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key_here # Optional: For enhanced scraping
```

## 2. Example Usage

You can describe components directly or provide API docs for integration.

**Basic Components:**

```
"create a modern pricing card"
"build a contact form with validation" 
"design a hero section with call-to-action"
```

**Based on API Docs:**

```
"create a pricing card integrated with http://billingsdk.com/ http://dodopayments.com/"
"create a user profile with Supabase authentication"
"build a payment form integrated with Stripe"
"design a dashboard with real-time data from Firebase"
```

**Advanced Components:**

```
"create a multi-step form with progress tracking"
"build a data visualization dashboard with charts"
"design a e-commerce product catalog with filtering"
```

## 3. Why Origin UI?

We chose **Origin UI** over shadcn (as required) because it:
- Provides modern, accessible design tokens and prebuilt patterns
- Is less overused, making component outputs more unique
- Integrates smoothly with TailwindCSS and TypeScript

All generated components follow Origin UI conventions with full type safety.

## 4. Tools, Workflows & Trade-offs

**Tools & Stack:**
- **Next.js 15 (App Router)** → scalable architecture
- **AI SDK v5** → orchestration + tool integration
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** → fast, reliable LLM generation
- **Origin UI + TailwindCSS** → design system & styling
- **CodeMirror 6** → syntax highlighting
- **Firecrawl** → enhanced web scraping and crawling

**Workflows:**
- Real-time streaming chat (split-screen: chat + preview)
- Multi-API Fetch URLs with parallel scraping
- Context passed into AI for accurate code generation
- Auto-generated usage docs for each component

**Trade-offs:**
- Focused on Origin UI → limits flexibility for teams preferring other UI libraries
- Crawling can be rate-limited depending on the docs' protection
- Preview runs in iframe sandbox → safer, but slightly slower rendering

## 🎯 Core Features

### 💬 Split-Screen Chat Interface
- **Real-time streaming** responses with live component preview
- **Responsive design** - chat on left, component preview on right
- **Message persistence** with conversation history
- **Professional UI** using Origin UI design system

### 🌐 Enhanced Documentation Intelligence
- **Smart scraping** - automatically detects documentation sites for comprehensive crawling
- **Site-wide crawling** with Firecrawl for complete documentation coverage
- **Intelligent content filtering** - AI-powered relevance filtering based on user requests  
- **Topic extraction** - automatically identifies relevant components/features from user requests
- **Parallel scraping** of multiple documentation sources with intelligent fallbacks
- **Anti-bot measures** with realistic headers and advanced proxy rotation
- **Intelligent analysis** - extracts API endpoints, auth methods, integration patterns
- **Context integration** - passes filtered, relevant documentation context to AI

### 🧩 AI-Powered Component Generation
- **Context-aware generation** using scraped documentation
- **Origin UI components** with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Multiple component types** - pricing cards, forms, dashboards, modals
- **Production-ready code** with error handling and loading states

### 🔍 Live Component Preview
- **Sandboxed iframe** preview with real-time updates
- **Syntax highlighting** with CodeMirror integration
- **Tab system** - Preview | Code | Instructions
- **Auto-generated documentation** with installation guides

## 🧪 Verified Multi-API Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Billing & Payments Integration
"create a pricing card integrated with http://billingsdk.com/ http://dodopayments.com/"
✅ Result: 2,823 characters of context, complete integration guide

# Example 2: Documentation-focused Integration  
"create a pricing card integrated with http://billingsdk.com/ https://docs.dodopayments.com/introduction"
✅ Result: 3,154 characters of context, 20+ API endpoints extracted
```
